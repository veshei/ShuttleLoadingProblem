# ShuttleLoadingProblem
You are in charge of choosing which of the n experimental gadgets G_1, G_2, ..., G_n are to be transported to the International Space Station. The gadgets' weights are w_1, w_2, ..., w_n and the future profits from the experiments conducted with the help of those gadgets are estimated as p_1, p_2, ..., p_n respectively. Naturally, transporting goods to the ISS is very expensive, and you have a weight limit W for the total weight of the gadgets you are allowed to put on the space shuttle. In this contest you are to write a program which given the gadgets' profits
p_1, p_2, ...., p_n,
their weights
w_1, w_2, ..., w_n,
and the weight limit W, determines which gadgets to take on the shuttle in order to maximize the future profit.
